// FAQ Section Data
export const faqData = {
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is income from agriculture really 100% tax-free in India?",
      answer:
        "Yes. As per Section 10(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, income earned from agricultural operations in India is exempt from Central Government income tax. We provide all necessary documentation for your records.",
    },
    {
      question: "What documents do I need to provide?",
      answer:
        "To finalize the Managed Farming Agreement, we require standard land ownership documents for verification: the Title Deed, latest Property Tax Receipts, and an Encumbrance Certificate (EC) to ensure the title is clear.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your 'guarantee' and how does it work?",
      answer:
        "Our guarantee ensures your investment is protected. If your farm does not produce a minimum of 2 kgs per plant by the end of Year 4, we will manage your farm completely FREE of charge in Year 5 and beyond, until it hits that benchmark. Your success is our success.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much of my time and effort is required?",
      answer:
        "Virtually zero. Our model is 'Done-For-You'. You provide the land and capital; we handle 100% of the work, from initial setup to harvesting and sales. You'll receive regular updates via WhatsApp and our portal, so you're always in the loop without being on the ground.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you achieve smarter farming through technology?",
      answer:
        "We use satellite land analysis, AI-powered soil data from global databases, historical climate viability analysis, and automated farm management with IoT sensors. Our systems monitor soil moisture, control drip irrigation, and provide 24/7 optimization to ensure maximum yields with minimal waste.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the biggest risks and how do you mitigate them?",
      answer:
        "The main risks are climate events and pests. We mitigate these with climate-controlled polyhouses, advanced pest management protocols, and comprehensive crop insurance. Our tech-driven approach also allows for early detection and prevention of potential issues.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any ongoing costs after the initial investment?",
      answer:
        "Yes, there is a monthly maintenance fee of ‚Çπ15,000 to cover ongoing farm operations including plant care, irrigation management, pest control, fertilization, and regular monitoring. This operational cost is separate from your initial ‚Çπ4,000 per plant setup investment and ensures professional maintenance throughout the 15-year management period.",
