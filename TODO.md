# Darjberry Project - Multi-Agent Development To-Do List

## Project Overview

Building a managed blueberry farming platform with Next.js that transforms unused land into passive income-generating agricultural assets. Landing page now complete with conversion-optimized design using 54321 psychology.

## Design Language Insighthttps://in.linkedin.com/in/vaibhav-shere-5379031b7s

### Landing Page Design (from nature/community images):

- **Clean, minimalist aesthetic** with nature-focused imagery
- **Serif/script typography** for headlines, sans-serif for body text
- **Natural color palette**: greens, blues, earth tones, with bright accent colors (lime green for CTAs)
- **Hero sections** with full-width nature photography
- **Card-based layouts** with rounded corners
- **Community-focused messaging** emphasizing environmental impact
- **Visual storytelling** through lifecycle imagery and growth progressions

### Admin Dashboard Design (from dashboard images):

- **Mobile-first approach** with dark mode interface
- **Modern, bold typography** using sans-serif fonts (appears to be similar to Lufga or similar geometric fonts)
- **Color scheme**:
  - Dark backgrounds (#0A0A0A)
  - Vibrant accent colors: Lime yellow (#EBFF57), Mint green (#A2F7A1), Pure white (#FFFFFF)
  - High contrast for accessibility
- **Card-based widgets** with rounded corners and glass-morphism effects
- **Data visualization** using circular progress indicators and pattern overlays
- **Minimalist icons** with consistent stroke weight
- **Bottom navigation** for mobile with haptic-style icons
- **Overview cards** showing key metrics (soil pH, moisture, nutrients, total tests, satisfaction rates)
- **Modern UI patterns**: floating action buttons, gradient overlays, micro-interactions
