DARJBERRY - ARCHITECTURE EXPLANATION (RUBBER DUCK DEBUGGING)

## Let's Walk Through the Architecture

### Starting Point: Why This Architecture?

The Darjberry platform is essentially a bridge between non-technical landowners and high-tech agriculture. Our architecture needs to handle:
1. Offline field operations (poor connectivity in rural areas)
2. Real-time monitoring of biological assets (plants don't wait)
3. Financial transactions with audit trails
4. Multi-tenant isolation (each customer's data is sacred)
5. Scale from 10 to 1000+ farms without breaking

### Frontend Architecture Decisions

**Why PWA for Customers?**
- Most landowners use mobile phones, not laptops
- PWAs work offline and feel native
- No app store friction - just share a link
- Updates automatically without user action
- Service workers cache critical data for offline viewing

**Why Native for Field Teams?**
- Need deep OS integration (camera, GPS, sensors)
- Must work completely offline for hours
- Background sync when connection available
- Better performance for data-heavy operations
- Can access device storage for large datasets

**The Smart Sync Pattern**
```
Field App → SQLite → Queue → Sync Service → API → PostgreSQL
```
This pattern ensures:
- Field teams never blocked by connectivity
- Data eventually consistent
- Conflict resolution handled gracefully
- No data loss even if app crashes

### Backend Service Architecture

**Why Microservices-ish?**
We're not going full microservices (that's overkill), but logical separation helps:
- Customer Service: Handles identity, KYC, preferences
- Farm Service: Core business logic, health algorithms
- Operations Service: Task scheduling, route optimization
- Financial Service: Money movement, compliance

**The Event-Driven Pattern**
Every significant action emits events:
```
Customer creates farm → FarmCreatedEvent → 
  ├── Schedule setup tasks
  ├── Send welcome message
  ├── Initialize monitoring
  └── Create financial records
```

This decouples services and creates an audit trail by default.

### Data Architecture Deep Dive

**PostgreSQL as Truth Source**
- ACID compliance for financial data
- Row-level security for multi-tenancy
- JSON columns for flexible schemas
- PostGIS for location queries

**Redis for Speed**
- Session storage (customers stay logged in)
- API response caching (same request = instant response)
- Pub/sub for real-time updates
- Temporary data like OTPs

**The Smart Caching Strategy**
Not everything needs caching:
- User sessions: 24 hours (security vs convenience)
- Farm data: 1 hour (changes slowly)
- Analytics: 15 minutes (near real-time is fine)
- API responses: 5 minutes (balance freshness and load)

### Integration Architecture Wisdom

**WhatsApp as Primary Channel**
Why? Because that's where farmers are:
- 95% smartphone penetration in target market
- Familiar interface
- Works on low-end devices
- Supports media (progress photos)
- Business API provides delivery receipts

**Satellite Analysis Magic**
We're not storing satellite images (too expensive). Instead:
```
Location → Google Earth Engine → Analysis → Score → Cache Result
```
This gives us:
- No storage costs
- Always latest imagery
- Professional-grade analysis
- Fast feasibility reports

### Security & Compliance Thinking

**Multi-Tenant Isolation**
Each request carries tenant context:
```typescript
// Every DB query automatically scoped
WHERE tenant_id = context.tenantId
```
This prevents data leaks between customers.

**PII Encryption**
Sensitive data encrypted at field level:
- Aadhaar numbers
- Bank accounts  
- Phone numbers (hashed for lookups)

**Audit Everything**
Every state change logged:
- Who did what when
- Previous and new values
- IP addresses and user agents
- Immutable event log

### Performance Optimizations Explained

**Database Performance**
- Indexes on common query patterns
- Materialized views for analytics
- Read replicas for reporting
- Connection pooling

**API Performance**
- Field selection (don't send unnecessary data)
- Cursor pagination (handles large datasets)
- DataLoader pattern (solves N+1 queries)
- Response compression

**The Offline-First Mobile Pattern**
```javascript
// Try network first, fall back to cache
const data = await fetch('/api/farms')
  .catch(() => cache.get('farms'))
```

### Scalability Strategy

**Horizontal Scaling**
- Stateless API servers (scale out)
- Queue workers (add more as needed)
- Database read replicas
- CDN for static assets

**The Sharding Future**
When we hit 10,000+ farms:
- Shard by geographic region
- Each region gets dedicated resources
- Cross-region queries rare

### Monitoring Philosophy

**Business Metrics First**
- How many farms are healthy?
- Are payments flowing?
- Is customer satisfaction high?

**Technical Metrics Support**
- API latency impacts user experience
- Queue depth indicates processing delays
- Error rates signal problems

**The Alert Hierarchy**
1. Customer-impacting issues (page immediately)
2. Degraded performance (notify on-call)
3. Anomalies (log for investigation)

### Disaster Recovery Reality Check

**What Can Go Wrong?**
- Primary database fails
- Payment gateway down
- WhatsApp API rate limited
- Satellite service unavailable
- Field app can't sync

**Our Mitigations**
- Database: Automated failover to replica
- Payments: Queue and retry with exponential backoff
- WhatsApp: Fallback to SMS
- Satellite: Cache results for 30 days
- Field app: Store months of data locally

**The 4-Hour RTO**
We promise back online in 4 hours because:
- Automated failover handles most issues
- Runbooks for manual interventions
- Regular disaster drills
- Off-site backups always ready

### Development & Deployment Philosophy

**GitOps Everything**
- Infrastructure as code
- Deployments triggered by git commits
- Rollbacks are just reverts
- Environment parity (dev = staging = prod)

**The Progressive Rollout**
```
Canary (5%) → Partial (25%) → Full (100%)
```
With automatic rollback on error spike.

### Cost Optimization Built-In

**Pay for What You Use**
- Serverless for sporadic workloads
- Reserved instances for predictable load
- Spot instances for batch processing
- S3 lifecycle policies for old data

**The Smart Storage Strategy**
- Hot data: PostgreSQL (last 90 days)
- Warm data: S3 (90 days - 1 year)  
- Cold data: Glacier (1+ years)

### Future-Proofing Decisions

**API Versioning**
```
/api/v1/farms
/api/v2/farms  # New fields, backward compatible
```

**Feature Flags**
```typescript
if (featureFlags.isEnabled('advanced-analytics')) {
  // New feature code
}
```

**The Data Model Flexibility**
JSON columns for evolving requirements:
```sql
metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
```

### Common Architectural Patterns

**The Repository Pattern**
Abstracts database access:
```typescript
class FarmRepository {
  async findById(id: string): Promise<Farm> {
    // Can switch from PostgreSQL to MongoDB
    // without changing service code
  }
}
```

**The Service Layer**
Business logic lives here:
```typescript
class FarmService {
  async createFarm(data: CreateFarmDTO) {
    // Validation
    // Business rules
    // Side effects
    // Return result
  }
}
```

**The DTO Pattern**
Type safety across boundaries:
```typescript
class CreateFarmDTO {
  @IsNumber()
  area: number
  
  @IsLatLong()
  coordinates: string
}
```

### Why This Architecture Works

1. **It Respects Reality**
   - Farmers use WhatsApp, not email
   - Field teams face poor connectivity
   - Money must be traceable
   - Biological assets need constant monitoring

2. **It's Pragmatic**
   - Not over-engineered
   - Uses boring, proven technology
   - Optimizes for developer productivity
   - Costs scale with revenue

3. **It's Resilient**
   - Handles failures gracefully
   - Degrades functionality, doesn't die
   - Self-healing where possible
   - Manual overrides when needed

4. **It's Evolvable**
   - Clear boundaries between components
   - Well-documented interfaces
   - Feature flags for safe rollouts
   - Data model supports changes

### The Architecture Smells We Avoided

❌ **Over-Engineering**
- No Kubernetes for 10 users
- No GraphQL when REST works fine
- No blockchain for audit logs

❌ **Under-Engineering**
- Not "everything in one MongoDB"
- Not "we'll add security later"
- Not "scaling is tomorrow's problem"

❌ **Technology Fashion**
- No "latest JS framework of the month"
- No "serverless all the things"
- No "AI/ML everywhere"

### Conclusion

This architecture is like a well-planned farm:
- Strong foundation (PostgreSQL, Next.js)
- Efficient irrigation (event-driven communication)
- Protection from weather (error handling, fallbacks)
- Room to grow (horizontal scaling)
- Clear boundaries (service separation)
- Regular maintenance (monitoring, updates)

It's not perfect, but it's good enough to start, robust enough to scale, and flexible enough to evolve. Most importantly, it serves our users - landowners seeking passive income and field teams needing reliable tools.

The architecture is our promise to the business: "We've thought this through, we can build it, we can run it, and it will grow with you."
